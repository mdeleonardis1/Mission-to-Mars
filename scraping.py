# Assign slide_elm as variable to look for the <div /> tag and other desecendent <div/> element
# This is our parent element. This means that this element holds all of the other elements within it,
# and we'll reference it when we want to filter search results even further. The . is used for selecting 
# classes, such as list_text, so the code 'div.list_text' pinpoints the <div /> tag with the class of list_text. 
# CSS works from right to left, such as returning the last item on the list instead of the first. Because of this, 
# when using select_one, the first matching element returned will be a <li />
# element with a class of slide and all nested elements within it.

slide_elem = news_soup.select_one('div.list_text')

slide_elem.find('div', class_='content_title')

# In this line of code, we chained .find onto our previously assigned variable, 
# slide_elem. When we do this, we're saying, "This variable holds a ton of 
# information, so look inside of that information to find this specific data."
# The data we're looking for is the content title, which we've specified by saying, 
# "The specific data is in a <div /> with a class of 'content_title'."

# Use the parent element to find the first `a` tag and save it as `news_title`
news_title = slide_elem.find('div', class_='content_title').get_text()
news_title

# IMPORTANT
# There are two methods used to find tags and attributes with BeautifulSoup:

# .find() is used when we want only the first class and attribute we've specified.
# .find_all() is used when we want to retrieve all of the tags and attributes.
# For example, if we were to use .find_all() instead of .find() when pulling the summary, we would retrieve 
# all of the summaries on the page instead of just the first one.

news_p = slide_elem.find('div', class_='article_teaser_body').get_text()

# Parse the resulting html with soup
html = browser.html
img_soup = soup(html, 'html.parser')

# It's important to note that the value of the src will be different every time the page is updated, 
# so we can't simply record the current 
# valueâ€”we would only pull that image each time the code is executed, 

# instead of the most recent one.# Find the relative image url
img_url_rel = img_soup.find('img', class_='fancybox-image').get('src')
img_url_rel

# Use the base URL to create an absolute URL
